WIP: 
- Can make this more extensible and explore more chrome extension features.
- Potentially make it seamless where user just fills fields, clicks on some sort of action to register it as "remember", and everything else is automated.

Chrome extension features to explore:
- Chrome local storage to dynamically store user data - [link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage)
